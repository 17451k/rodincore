<h1>Reasoners</h1>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>Reasoners are used in Event-B Sequent Prover to generate
<a href="proofRules.html">Proof Rules</a>. A reasoner is provided with the 
sequent to prove as well as some extra optional input. The reasoner is 
implemented by a computer program and it is the job of the developers to ensure
that the reasoners either fail or generate logically valid proof rules.</p>
<p>An example of a reasoner is the "conjI" reasoner that generates the conjI 
proof rules, which splits a conjunctive goal into two sub-goals. Here, assume 
that the input sequent is "A, B, C |- D & E", the conjI reasoner produces the 
following proof rules.</p>
<p>
A, B, C |- D  &nbsp &nbsp   A, B, C |- E
<br>
--------------------------------------
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp A, B, C |- D & E
</p>

<h2>Adding a reasoner</h2>
<p>A reasoner is added into the Event-B Sequent Prover using the extension point
<code>org.eventb.core.seqprover.reasoners</code>. Below are an example of how to contribute
to the extension point.</p>
<font color="#4444cc">
<pre>
&lt;extension point="org.eventb.core.seqprover.reasoners">
   &lt;reasoner
      class="org.eventb.contributors.seqprover.reasoners.Hyp"
      id="hyp"
      name="%hypName"/>
&lt;/extension>
</pre>
</font>
<p>The above declaration defines a reasoner with a specific id (which will automatically prefix
by the project name, e.g. <code>org.eventb.contributors.seqprover</code>). The
name is an externalised string that is used for displaying purpose.</p>
<p>The class attribute must be a valid Java class name which will be used to create
an instance of the reasoner. This class must implements 
<code>org.eventb.core.seqprover.IReasoner</code> interface.</p> However, most of
 he time, developers only need to extends one of the abstract implementation
 (depending on the type of the reasoner). For this implementation purpose, the 
    type of the reasonners are specified as below:
    
    <ol>
      <li>Automatic rewriting reasoners: Reasoners which apply some rewriting
      rules automatically to simplify the sequent.
	
      <li>Automatic inference reasoners: Reasoners which apply an inference
      rule automatically.

      <li>Manual rewriters: Reasoners which apply a rewriting rule at a given
	position.

      <li>Manual inference: Reasoner which apply an inference rule manually.
      
      <li>General reasoners: If the reasoner does not fall into the above
      categories, clients needs to implements the interface IReasoner directly.
    </ol>

<p>
Implementing a reasoner is only a first step of contributing to the Sequent
Prover. In order to use a reasoner, the reasoner needs to be wrap around by
a tactic.
