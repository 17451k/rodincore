Creating Icons for the RODIN platform.
==============================

The file RODIN_icon_source.xcf is a GIMP file containing the source from which the RODIN icons were created using GIMP. Each icon consists of three parts:

1. The Gradient Background
2. The Border
3. The Contents

Each of these parts consists of one (or more) layers in GIMP. Each icon has a base colour. The contents colour is normally white, and the background colour is white. The icon is assumed to be set in a white, or light coloured background.

To create a new icon:

0. Open the RODIN_icon_source.xcf file in gimp.
1. Choose your base colour (preferably one from the eclipse pallette)
2. Create a new layer for your gradient background.
3. Select the "Inner Stroke Circle path"
4. Set the foreground colour to the base colour, and the background colour to the base colour with 50% less saturation (or white).
5. Use the gradient tool to fill the selected area. To have the proper lighting effect, select the gradient from the centre of the selection to the upper left corner. Experiment with this until it looks right.
6. Create a new layer for the border.
7. Go to the paths tab and select the Inner stroke circle path and click on "Stroke path" on the bottom.
8. Choose a line width of 20 pixels. (the foreground color should be your base colour)
9. Create the contents as a layer in white, and if needed, another layer with a stroke of the base colour in case the contrast is too low with the base colour.
10. View all the created layers with each other, and the white background to make sure everything looks good.
11. Save a copy of the file.

Exporting to a .gif icon
-------------------------------

1. Make the white background invisible , and instead make the layer "White Circle background" visible (this is to cope with the limited transparency capabilities of gif)
2. Scale the icon to the desired size using BIcubic interpolation (Do not save the file original after this point)
3. "Save a copy" of the file as a .gif  (select save transparency information)
