/**
 * Common protocol for Event-B Proof Status (PS) files.
 * <p>
 * The PS file records the status of the proof (in the PR file) of each proof 
 * obligation (in the PO file). In order to be consistent with the PO and PR files, 
 * it must:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Contain one proof status element for each proof obligation in the PO file. These 
 * proof status elements and proof obligations must share the same names, and occur in the 
 * same order.
 * <li> Each proof status element must faithfully record the status of the proof in the PR file
 * associated to it (i.e. with the same element name)
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The convention used for associating proof obligations (IPOSequent) in the PO file to 
 * proof status elements (IPSStatus) in the PS file, and proofs (in the PR file) is that 
 * they all have the identical element names.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
