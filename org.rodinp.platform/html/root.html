<h1>The Rodin Platform</h1>
<p>
Rodin  is an open tool platform for the cost effective rigorous
development of dependable complex software systems and services. 
This platform is based on the event-B formal method and
provides natural support for refinement and mathematical proof.
</p><p>
This platform contributes to the Eclipse framework 
and is extensible using the Eclipse plug-in mechanism.
</p><p>
Rodin development has been partly funded 
by the European Commission through two RTD projects:
<ul>
<li>project <a href="http://rodin.cs.ncl.ac.uk/">Rodin</a> (FP6 IST
 project 511599), from September 2004 to  October 2007,</li>
<li>project <a href="http://www.deploy-project.eu/">Deploy</a> (FP7 IST
 project 214158), since February 2008.</li>
</ul></p><p>
More information about this platform can be found on the
<a href="http://www.event-b.org">Event-B.org</a> web site, including user and
developer documentation available as a
<a href="http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/Main_Page">Wiki</a>. </p><p>
The development of this platform is hosted by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rodin-b-sharp">SourceForge</a>.</p>
<h2>Important Installation notes</h2>
