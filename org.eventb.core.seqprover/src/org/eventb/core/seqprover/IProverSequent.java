/**
 * Common protocol for reading Prover Sequents.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A sequent contains:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A <em>goal</em> : the predicate to be proven.
 * <li> A set of <em>hypotheses</em>: predicates that can be used 
 * to prove the goal.
 * <li> A <em>type environment</em> containing all free identifiers 
 * and carrier sets appearing in the goal and hypotheses.
 * </ul>
 * The fact that all predicates in the sequent share a common type environment ensures
 * that every free identifier has a unique type and makes the search for fresh
 * free identifiers easier.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to the explicitly stated set of hypotheses, the well-definedness 
 * predicates for each hypothesis and the goal may be assumed to prove the goal.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The set of hypotheses contains two subsets:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <em>Selected</em> hypotheses : hypotheses thought to be relevant while proving
 * the goal.
 * <li> <em>Hidden</em> hypotheses : hypotheses thought to be strongly irrelevant,
 * redundant, or misleading while proving the goal. 
 * </ul>
 * These two subsets are disjoint and need not contain all hypotheses. These
 * subsets have no logical significance. Their sole purpose is to add structure
 * to sequents with a large number of hypotheses. Their sizes are intended to be
 * smaller in comparason the set of all hypotheses.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Prover sequents are implemented as immutable. They are created using factory methods
 * in {@link ProverFactory}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To avoid needless copying, modifications to prover sequents are treated internally
 * as incremental constructions. 
 * The methods used for incrementally constructing new prover sequents from existing
 * ones are not currently exported, but can be found in {@link IInternalProverSequent}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
