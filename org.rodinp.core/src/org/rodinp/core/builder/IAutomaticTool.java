 * A tool must register an extractor <code>IExtractor</code> and a tool <code>IAutomaticTool</code>.
 * An automatic tool is the actual tool to be run, whereas the extractor specifies when it is to be run.
 * A tool must react to cancelation requests from a progress monitor. As specified for
 * progress monitors, on a cancelation request the tool must throw an <code>OperationCanceledException</code>.
 * The builder may or may not accept a completed operation in either case, but it should be assumed
 * that the entire work of the tool will be discarded.
 * A producer supplies to operations:
 * <ul>
 * <li> <code>run()</code>: the tool produces some target file "file" </li>
 * <li> <code>clean()</code>: the tool deletes some target file "file" </li>
