 * The Model is used to present the structure of the machines and contexts and
 * the proof obligations. For a machine, context, invariant, theorem, axiom and
 * event it shows what proof obligations are tied to it. The Model also shows
 * the dependencies between machines and contexts. I.e. how the machines refine
 * each other, what contexts they see and how the contexts extend each other.
 * The Model is built by the ModelController. The modeling of the machines and
 * contexts is triggered by the context providers that provide the machines and
 * context. The modeling of the proof obligations is triggered by the content
 * provider for the POs (POContentProvider)
