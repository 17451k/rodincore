/**
 * A proof tree delta describes changes in a proof tree between two discrete
 * points in time. Given a delta, clients can access all proof tree node that
 * have changed.
 * <p>
 * Deltas have different flags depending on the kind of change they represent.
 * The list below summarizes each flag (as returned by <code>getFlags</code>)
 * and its meaning (see individual constants for a more detailed description):
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>COMMENT</code> - The comment of the node described by the delta 
 * has a changed. 
 * <li><code>CONFIDENCE</code> - The node described by the delta has changed
 * confidence level.
 * <li><code>CHILDREN</code> - The children of the node described by the
 * delta have changed. </li>
 * <li><code>RULE</code> - The rule associated to this node has changed. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A proof tree delta tree always starts at the root node of a proof tree.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>IProofTreeDelta</code> objects are not valid outside the dynamic
 * scope of the notification.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
