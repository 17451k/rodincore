 * to manipulate the dependency graph of all Rodin resources of a Rodin
 * project. It is a Facade to the more complicated ways of manipulating
 * the dependency graph inside the builder.
 * </p><p>
 * Some information is cached in the corresponding object so the contents
 * of the facade must be synchronised with the graph at the end of an extraction.
 * </p><p>
 * Requests to add nodes to the graph must be made
 * explicitly by methods <code>addNode()</code>.
 * Dependencies are managed by the facade. This saves clients from having 
 * to compute dependency graph deltas themselves. Dependency graph manipulation
 * uses a transaction mechanism behind the scenes. If the was any problem a
 * <code>CoreException</code> is thrown.
