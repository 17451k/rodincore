<h1>Adding a Post-tactic</h1>

<p>
Post-tactics are the tactics that run by after every manual proof steps in
interactive mode. Only automatic tactics (See <a href="tactics.html">About tactics</a>) 
can be declared as Post-tactic.
</p>
<p>
Post-tactics are added using the extension point <code>org.eventb.core.postTactic</code>.
An example is as follows:
</p>

<font color="#4444cc">
<pre>
   &lt;extension
         point="org.eventb.core.postTactics">
      &lt;tactic id="org.eventb.core.seqprover.trueGoalTac"/>
   &lt;/extension>
</pre>
</font>
<p>
Each <code>tactic</code> element contains only attribute <code>id</code> which
must be a valid tactic ID (including the project prefix) as declared using 
<code>org.eventb.core.seqprover.autoTactics</code> extension point.
</p>

Once declared as a Post-Tactic, the information about the tactic will appear in
the preferences for the Post-Tactic and the users of the platform. However, this
tactic will not be a default Post-Tactic and the users must change the preference
to enable this tactic.
