<h1>The Rodin Platform</h1>
<p>
Rodin  is an open tool platform for the cost effective rigorous
development of dependable complex software systems and services. 
This platform is based on the event-B formal method and
provides natural support for refinement and mathematical proof.

This platform contributes to the Eclipse framework 
and is extensible using the Eclipse plug-in mechanism.
</p><p>
Rodin development has been partly funded 
by the European Union (<a href="http://rodin.cs.ncl.ac.uk/">IST
 project n&deg; 511599</a>), from September 2004 to  October 2007.
</p><p>
More information about this platform can be found on the
<a href="http://rodin-b-sharp.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> web site
hosting the development of this platform.
