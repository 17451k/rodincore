 * Base interface for a prover module.

 * This method should return clauses that are derived when trying to detect
 * a contradiction. Method {@link #next(boolean)} is then called on each prover
 * module until one of them returns a result different from {@link ProverResult#EMPTY_RESULT}.
 * <p>
 * When a contradiction is detected, the level is first adjusted by the {@link ClauseDispatcher}
 * and the proof is terminated if the base level is closed. If not, {@link #contradiction(Level, Level, Set)}
 * is first called on each prover module. Then, the {@link ClauseDispatcher} backtracks
 * its data structure and calls {@link #removeClause(Clause)} on each prover module
 * for all backtracked clauses.
