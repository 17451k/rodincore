/**
 * Common protocol for specifying a location in the Rodin database. A location
 * can be
 * <ul>
 * <li>either a Rodin element ({@link IRodinLocation}),</li>
 * <li>or an internal element ({@link IInternalLocation}),</li>
 * <li>or an attribute of an internal element ({@link IAttributeLocation}),</li>
 * <li>or a substring of a string attribute of an internal element (
 * {@link IAttributeSubstringLocation}).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Locations are handle-only. The items referenced by a location may exist or
 * not exist. The Rodin database may hand out any number of instances for each
 * location. Instances that refer to the same location are guaranteed to be
 * equal, but not necessarily identical.
