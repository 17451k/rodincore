/**
 * Common protocol for a refines clause in a machine.

 * This interface provides methods for accessing and manipulating the name of
 * the abstract machine. We call the machine that is refined by the machine
 * containing this element, the <em>abstract machine</em>. This is to avoid
 * confusion by using the term <em>refined machine</em> which could be either
 * machine in a refinement relationship.
