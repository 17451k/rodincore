/**
 * Common protocol for type environments.
 * <p>
 * A type environment is a map from names to their respective type. It is used
 * by the formula type-checker as both an input and output.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * More precisely, the type-checker takes as input a type environment which
 * gives the type of some names and produce as output a new type environment
 * that records the types inferred from the formula.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients. Use
 * {@link FormulaFactory#makeTypeEnvironment()} to create new type environments.
